# Audio Processing System Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the audio processing system in the BallTalk app.

## 1. Unit Testing

### Core Services

- **AudioEngine**
  - Test initialization and resource management
  - Test audio loading and unloading
  - Test playback controls (play, pause, stop, seek)
  - Test processing mode switching
  - Test event listeners

- **DolbyMasteringService**
  - Test authentication header generation
  - Test preview generation
  - Test mastering with different options
  - Test preset management

- **NectarVocalService**
  - Test module creation and management
  - Test preset loading and application
  - Test processing chain manipulation

### Processing Modules

- **DeEsserModule**
  - Test initialization with different options
  - Test parameter updates
  - Test processing chain connections
  - Test bypass functionality

- **EqualizerModule**
  - Test band creation and management
  - Test different EQ modes
  - Test mid/side processing

## 2. Integration Testing

- **AudioEngine + Processing Services**
  - Test end-to-end processing flow
  - Test switching between processing modes
  - Test preset application across services

- **UI Components + Audio Services**
  - Test UI control updates reflecting audio state
  - Test parameter changes affecting processing
  - Test visualization updates during playback

## 3. End-to-End Testing

### User Flows

1. **Basic Audio Processing**
   - Load an audio file
   - Apply processing
   - Export processed audio
   - Verify output quality

2. **Mastering Workflow**
   - Load an audio file
   - Generate previews
   - Select a profile
   - Adjust parameters
   - Process with Dolby.io
   - Save and export result

3. **Vocal Processing Workflow**
   - Load a vocal recording
   - Apply de-essing
   - Adjust EQ
   - Add compression and reverb
   - Process and export

4. **Preset Management**
   - Create custom presets
   - Save presets to Firebase
   - Load presets
   - Apply presets to new audio

## 4. Performance Testing

- **Processing Time**
  - Measure processing time for different file lengths
  - Compare local vs. cloud processing times
  - Optimize for mobile performance

- **Memory Usage**
  - Monitor memory usage during processing
  - Identify and fix memory leaks
  - Optimize for low-end devices

## 5. Cross-Platform Testing

- **iOS Testing**
  - Test on iPhone (latest and iPhone 11)
  - Test on iPad
  - Verify audio permissions

- **Android Testing**
  - Test on high-end Android devices
  - Test on mid-range Android devices
  - Verify audio permissions

## 6. Automated Testing

- **Jest Tests**
  - Set up Jest for unit testing
  - Create mocks for audio APIs
  - Implement CI/CD pipeline

- **Detox Tests**
  - Set up Detox for E2E testing
  - Create test scenarios for main user flows
  - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline

## 7. Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Audio file selection works on all platforms
- [ ] Playback controls function correctly
- [ ] Waveform visualization is accurate
- [ ] Parameter controls update in real-time
- [ ] Processing completes without errors
- [ ] Processed audio sounds as expected
- [ ] Presets can be saved and loaded
- [ ] UI is responsive during processing
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on target devices

## 8. Testing Tools

- **Audio Analysis**
  - Use spectrum analyzers to verify processing quality
  - Compare before/after audio characteristics
  - Validate loudness standards compliance

- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Use React Native performance monitors
  - Track frame rates during UI interactions
  - Measure battery impact

## 9. Bug Reporting Process

1. Identify and document the issue
2. Capture reproduction steps
3. Note device and OS information
4. Include audio file sample if relevant
5. Assign priority and severity
6. Track in issue management system

## 10. Release Testing

- **Beta Testing**
  - Distribute to internal testers
  - Collect feedback on audio quality
  - Identify usability issues

- **Production Validation**
  - Verify Firebase integration
  - Test Dolby.io API in production environment
  - Validate analytics and monitoring
