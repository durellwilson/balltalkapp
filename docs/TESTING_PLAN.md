- Maintain high code quality and prevent regressions
- Verify app performance meets user expectations
- Ensure the app is accessible to all users
- Validate that the app meets business requirements

## Testing Environments

### Development Environment
- Local development machines
- Firebase Emulator Suite for backend services
- Mock data for testing

### Testing Environment
- Dedicated testing environment with isolated database
- Test accounts with various roles and permissions
- Simulated network conditions

### Staging Environment
- Production-like environment
- Real data (anonymized if necessary)
- Used for final validation before production release

### Production Environment
- Live environment
- Real user data

## Types of Testing

### Unit Testing
Testing individual components, functions, and modules in isolation.

**Tools:**
- Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- React Testing Library for component testing

**Coverage Targets:**
- Services: 80%

- Firebase interactions
- Component compositions
- Navigation flows

### End-to-End Testing
Testing complete user flows from start to finish.

**Tools:**
- Detox for mobile testing
- Cypress for web testing

**Key Flows:**
- User registration and login
- Profile creation and editing

    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Component Tests

```javascript
// Example component test for ProfileCard
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import ProfileCard from '../components/ProfileCard';

describe('ProfileCard', () => {
  test('renders user information correctly', () => {
    const user = {
      name: 'John Doe',
      role: 'athlete',
      avatar: 'https://example.com/avatar.jpg',
    };
    
    render(<ProfileCard user={user} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeTruthy();
    expect(screen.getByText('Athlete')).toBeTruthy();
  });
  
  test('calls onPress when pressed', () => {
    const onPress = jest.fn();
    render(<ProfileCard onPress={onPress} />);
    
    fireEvent.press(screen.getByTestId('profile-card'));
    
    expect(onPress).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```javascript
// Example integration test for chat functionality
describe('Chat Integration', () => {
  test('should send and receive messages', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('should update conversation list when new message arrives', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### End-to-End Tests

```javascript
// Example E2E test for login flow
describe('Login Flow', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await device.reloadReactNative();
  });
  
  test('should login successfully with valid credentials', async () => {
    await element(by.id('email-input')).typeText('test@example.com');
    await element(by.id('password-input')).typeText('password123');
    await element(by.id('login-button')).tap();
    
    await expect(element(by.text('Home'))).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

## Manual Testing

### Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing sessions should be conducted regularly to identify issues that automated tests might miss. Focus areas include:

- User experience
- Edge cases
- Visual design
- Error scenarios
- Device-specific issues

### User Acceptance Testing

Before each major release, conduct user acceptance testing with a group of beta testers representing different user personas:

- Athletes
- Fans
- Content creators
- New users
- Power users
