# BallTalk App Navigation Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix navigation issues in the BallTalk app. The app has been migrated from React Navigation to Expo Router, and several issues have been addressed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Import Statements

We've created a script (`scripts/update-navigation.js`) to update import statements that might be referencing old file locations. This script:

- Replaces `navigation.navigate()` calls with `router.push()`
- Updates imports from the old `screens` directory to the new `app` directory
- Fixes invalid navigation paths

### 2. Screen Integration

We've created a script (`scripts/check-screen-integration.js`) to check for screens that might need to be integrated. This script:

- Finds all `router.push()` calls
- Checks if the target screens exist
- Reports any missing screens

### 3. Documentation

We've created several documentation files to help with navigation:

- `docs/NAVIGATION-GUIDE.md`: A guide to navigating between screens
- `docs/NAVIGATION-TESTING.md`: A testing plan for navigation

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Invalid Navigation Paths

Some navigation paths may still need to be updated. The `scripts/check-screen-integration.js` script can help identify these issues.

### 2. Screen Integration

Some screens from the `/screens` directory may still need to be fully integrated into the `/app` directory. The `scripts/check-screen-integration.js` script can help identify these issues.

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the Scripts

Run the scripts to identify and fix any remaining issues:

```bash
node scripts/update-navigation.js
node scripts/check-screen-integration.js
```

### 2. Test Navigation

Test all navigation paths to ensure they work correctly. Use the `docs/NAVIGATION-TESTING.md` file as a guide.

### 3. Update Documentation

Update the documentation to reflect any changes made to the navigation system.

### 4. Code Review

Review the codebase for any remaining issues or inconsistencies.

## Conclusion

The BallTalk app has been successfully migrated from React Navigation to Expo Router. The navigation system is now more consistent and easier to maintain. However, there are still some issues that need to be addressed. By following the next steps outlined in this document, we can ensure that the navigation system works correctly and provides a seamless user experience.
