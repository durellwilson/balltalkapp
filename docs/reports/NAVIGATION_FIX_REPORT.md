# Navigation Fix Implementation Report

## Issue Fixed

Resolved the "Cannot use `href` and `tabBarButton` together" error that was preventing the app from starting up properly. This error was occurring in the tab navigation setup.

## Files Modified

1. **`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`**
   - Fixed the "discover" tab configuration by removing the `href` property when using `tabBarButton`
   - Instead of trying to use both properties in different ways, we completely removed the conflicting property

## Files Created

1. **`__tests__/TabNavigation.test.tsx`**
   - Added a test to verify the tab navigation renders correctly without errors
   - Mocks the necessary dependencies for testing

2. **`scripts/test-navigation.js`**
   - Created a script to run the navigation tests
   - Makes it easy to test navigation components regularly

3. **`scripts/deploy-to-firebase.js`**
   - Created a deployment script that builds and deploys the app to Firebase
   - Runs tests before deployment to catch issues early

4. **`docs/NAVIGATION_FIXES.md`**
   - Documented the navigation fix for future reference
   - Includes explanation of the root cause and solution
   - Added alternative approaches for custom routing needs

## README Updates

- Updated the "Navigation Setup and Troubleshooting" section in the README
- Documented the correct way to fix the "Cannot use `href` and `tabBarButton` together" error
- Emphasized that these properties are mutually exclusive in Expo Router
- Added instructions for running navigation tests

## Next Steps

1. **Run Tests**: Execute `node scripts/test-navigation.js` to verify the navigation components work correctly
2. **Deploy**: Run `node scripts/deploy-to-firebase.js` to build and deploy the fixed app to Firebase
3. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on error logs to ensure no related issues appear
