# BallTalk App Deployment Summary

## CI/CD Flow Execution

This document summarizes the CI/CD flow that was executed for the BallTalk app, focusing on the deployment of chat features to Firebase.

### Steps Executed

1. **Build Process**
   - Built the web application using `npm run build:web`
   - Fixed missing asset issue (demo-track.mp3)
   - Installed missing dependency (expo-clipboard)
   - Successfully generated the build in the `dist` directory

2. **Deployment to Firebase**
   - Deployed the application to Firebase hosting using `npm run deploy`
   - Deployed Firestore rules for chat functionality
   - Updated app configuration to enable chat features and premium groups
   - Created a preview channel for testing

3. **Testing**
   - Ran chat features tests using `npm run test:chat-features`
   - All tests passed, confirming that message reactions and read receipts are working correctly

4. **Verification**
   - Created a custom verification script to check the deployment
   - Verified that chat features are enabled in app.json
   - Confirmed that Firebase configuration is correct
   - Validated that Firestore rules include necessary chat-related rules

### Issues Encountered and Resolutions

1. **Missing Asset File**
   - **Issue**: Build failed due to missing `demo-track.mp3` file
   - **Resolution**: Created the assets/audio directory and copied a test audio file

2. **Missing Dependency**
   - **Issue**: Build failed due to missing `expo-clipboard` package
   - **Resolution**: Installed the package using `npm install expo-clipboard`

3. **App Configuration Structure**
