# BallTalk App - Project Overview

## Introduction

BallTalk is a collaborative music platform designed for athletes and their fans. The app allows athletes to create, record, and share audio content, while fans can listen, interact, and engage with their favorite athletes through various features including chat.

## Architecture

The BallTalk app is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- **Audio Processing**: Dolby.io Media API
- **Navigation**: Expo Router
- **State Management**: React Context API

## Core Features

1. **Authentication**
   - Email/Password, Google, and Apple Sign-In
   - Role-based access (Athlete vs Fan)
   - User profiles

2. **Audio Studio**
   - Recording interface
   - Audio enhancement
   - Vocal isolation
   - Batch processing

3. **Chat System**
   - Direct messaging
   - Group chats
   - Premium group chats
   - Message reactions
   - Read receipts

4. **Content Discovery**
   - Athlete profiles
   - Shared tracks
   - Community feed

5. **Offline Support**
   - Offline content access
   - Queued uploads
   - Sync when online

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   - `npm start` - Start the development server
   - `npm run web-clear` - Start web development with cache clearing
   - `npm run ios` - Start iOS development
   - `npm run android` - Start Android development

2. **Testing**
   - `npm test` - Run all tests
   - `npm run test:chat` - Run chat-specific tests
   - `npm run test:audio` - Run audio-specific tests

3. **Firebase Emulators**
   - `npm run emulators:setup` - Set up Firebase emulators
   - `npm run emulators:start` - Start Firebase emulators
   - `npm run start:emulators` - Start app with emulators

4. **Deployment**
   - `npm run build:web` - Build web version
   - `npm run deploy` - Deploy to Firebase hosting
   - `npm run deploy:expo:production` - Deploy to Expo production

## Current Issues and Roadmap

### Known Issues

1. **Firebase Index Errors**
   - Missing indexes for some queries
   - Solution: Update firestore.indexes.json

2. **Tab Bar Issues**
   - Extra tabs appearing in the tab bar
   - Solution: Clean up tab configuration in app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx

3. **Chat Functionality**
   - Non-functional chat features
   - Solution: Implement proper chat screens and services

4. **Live Updates**
   - Lack of updates in the feed
   - Solution: Implement proper Firebase listeners

### Roadmap

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Fix critical bugs (Firebase indexes, tab bar, chat)
   - Improve error handling
   - Add comprehensive documentation

2. **Mid-term (1-2 months)**
   - Enhance audio processing features
   - Improve offline support
   - Add analytics and monitoring

3. **Long-term (3+ months)**
   - Implement monetization features
   - Add advanced collaboration tools
   - Expand platform reach

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - Use the centralized error reporting system
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

2. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the established project structure
   - Use TypeScript for type safety
   - Document complex functions and components

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for critical functionality
   - Use integration tests for user flows
   - Test on multiple devices and platforms

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize large lists with FlatList
   - Use proper image caching
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders
