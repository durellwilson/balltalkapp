3. **Build Generation**
   - Run `expo build:ios` and `expo build:android`
   - Archive builds with version numbers
   - Generate release notes

### Testing Process

1. **Smoke Testing**
   - Verify basic functionality on real devices
   - Test critical user flows
   - Check for visual regressions

2. **Regression Testing**
   - Run automated test suite
   - Verify fixed bugs remain fixed
   - Test integration points with other systems

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure app startup time
   - Test audio processing performance
   - Verify memory usage during extended use

### Submission Process

1. **App Store Submission**
   - Prepare screenshots and metadata
   - Submit for review
   - Monitor review status

2. **Google Play Submission**
   - Update store listing
   - Upload APK/AAB
   - Set up staged rollout

## 4. Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Performance Monitoring

- **Firebase Performance**
  - Track app startup time
  - Monitor API call latency
  - Identify slow UI interactions

- **Crash Reporting**
  - Set up Firebase Crashlytics
  - Configure alerting for critical issues
  - Track crash-free user percentage

### Usage Analytics

- **Feature Adoption**
