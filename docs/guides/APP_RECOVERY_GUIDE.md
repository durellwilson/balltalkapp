# BallTalk App Recovery Guide

This guide provides steps to recover the BallTalk app from its current non-functional state. We've created specialized recovery scripts to fix the most common issues and restore core functionality.

## Quick Recovery

For a quick recovery of the app, follow these steps:

1. **Run the comprehensive recovery script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/app-recovery.js
   ```
   This script will:
   - Create a recovery branch
   - Fix dependencies
   - Update app configuration
   - Restore modern UI theme
   - Fix TypeScript configuration
   - Restore core functionality including audio recording

2. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Navigate to the recorder screen** at `/recorder` to test basic audio recording functionality

## Individual Recovery Scripts

If you prefer to address specific issues one by one:

### 1. Fix Navigation Issues

The original error "Cannot use `href` and `tabBarButton` together" should be fixed now. If navigation issues persist:

```bash
# Check navigation scripts manually
npx expo start
```

Then navigate to different screens to identify where the app is breaking.

### 2. Restore Recording Functionality

To restore just the audio recording functionality:

```bash
node scripts/restore-recording.js
```

This creates a basic audio recorder component and a screen to test it.

### 3. Refresh Dependencies

If you're having dependency issues:

```bash
npx expo install --fix
```

### 4. Clear Caches

For a fresh start with all caches cleared:

```bash
npm run clear-cache
# or
npx expo start --clear
```

## Troubleshooting Specific Features

### Studio Functionality

If the studio features still don't work after running the recovery script:

1. Check the browser console for specific errors
2. Verify that audio permissions are granted
3. Check if the audio components are loading correctly

### UI Issues

If the app still looks "clunky and boring":

1. The recovery script updates the theme with modern colors
2. Check that the ThemeProvider is properly applied in your app layout

### Errors After Recovery

If you still encounter errors after running the recovery scripts:

1. Run diagnostics: `npx expo doctor`
2. Check the log files for specific errors
3. Try starting with a minimal working example and building up functionality

## Long-Term Recovery Plan

For a more comprehensive recovery over time:

1. **Stabilize Core Features**: Focus on making the basic app work reliably
2. **Modular Rebuilding**: Incrementally rebuild complex features like the studio
3. **Modern UI Elements**: Apply consistent styling and user experience
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add tests to prevent regressions

## Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the `RECOVERY_REPORT.md` file generated by the recovery script
2. Review the browser console logs for specific error messages
3. Consider creating a new app with the latest Expo template and migrating your features one by one

The recovery scripts are designed to get your app back to a functional state as quickly as possible. Once the core functionality is working, you can iteratively improve and enhance the app's features.
