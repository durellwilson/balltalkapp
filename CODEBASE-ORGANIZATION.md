# BallTalk App Codebase Organization

## Overview

The BallTalk app has been reorganized to follow best practices for modern React Native with Expo and Firebase. The codebase now follows a consistent structure with features organized into logical directories.

## Directory Structure

## Feature Organization

### 1. Tab Navigation
- The app uses a tab-based navigation with 4 main tabs: Home, Studio, Profile, and Chat
- Each tab has its own stack navigation for nested screens

### 2. Studio Features
- All audio-related features are consolidated in the `/app/studio` directory
- Features include recording, mastering, library management, batch processing, etc.

### 3. Chat Features
- All chat-related features are consolidated in the `/app/chat` directory
- Features include conversations, group chats, premium groups, etc.

### 4. Authentication
- All authentication-related features are consolidated in the `/app/(auth)` directory
- Features include login, signup, athlete signup, etc.

### 5. Payment
- All payment-related features are consolidated in the `/app/payment` directory
- Features include subscription management, payment processing, etc.

### 6. Admin
- All admin-related features are consolidated in the `/app/admin` directory
- Features include verification, moderation, etc.

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Consistent File Naming**: All files follow kebab-case naming convention (e.g., `audio-mastering.tsx`)

2. **Logical Feature Organization**: Features are organized into logical directories based on functionality

3. **Stack Navigation for Feature Sections**: Each feature section has its own stack navigation

4. **Tab Navigation for Main Sections**: Main sections are accessible via tab navigation

5. **Error Boundaries**: The app uses error boundaries to handle errors gracefully

6. **Provider Pattern**: The app uses the provider pattern for state management

7. **Dynamic Routing**: The app uses dynamic routing for certain screens (e.g., `[id].tsx`)

## Next Steps

1. **Run the App**: Test the app to ensure all features work correctly

2. **Update Import Statements**: Check and update any import statements that might be referencing old file locations

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Run comprehensive tests as outlined in the `TESTING-PLAN.md` file

4. **Code Review**: Review the codebase for any remaining issues or inconsistencies

5. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new codebase organization
