# Authentication & Verification Guide for Ball Talk

## Overview

Ball Talk implements a comprehensive authentication system with role-based access control and a specialized verification workflow for professional athletes. This guide explains the authentication architecture, implementation details, and best practices.

## Authentication Architecture

The authentication system consists of these key components:

1. **AuthService**: Core service for authentication operations
2. **Firebase Authentication**: Backend authentication provider
3. **AuthContext**: React Context for managing authentication state
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for athletes, fans, and admins
5. **Athlete Verification Workflow**: Process for verifying professional athletes

## Authentication Methods

Ball Talk supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **Email/Password**: Traditional email and password authentication
2. **Google Sign-In**: OAuth authentication with Google
3. **Apple Sign-In**: Sign in with Apple for iOS devices

## User Roles

The application defines three primary user roles:

1. **Athlete**: Professional athletes who create and share music
2. **Fan**: Regular users who consume content
3. **Admin**: Administrative users who manage the platform

## Implementation Details

### AuthService

The `AuthService` class (`services/AuthService.ts`) provides these core functionalities:

- User registration and login
- Social authentication (Google, Apple)
- User profile management
- Athlete verification submission and review
- Session management

```typescript
// Example usage of AuthService
import { AuthService } from '../services/AuthService';

const authService = new AuthService();

// Sign up with email
const user = await authService.signUpWithEmail(
  'athlete@example.com',
  'password123',
  'athlete_username',
  'athlete'
);

// Sign in with email
const user = await authService.signInWithEmail(
  'athlete@example.com',
  'password123'
);

// Sign in with Google
const user = await authService.signInWithGoogle('preferred_username', 'fan');

// Sign out
await authService.signOut();
```

### AuthContext

The `AuthContext` (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) provides authentication state throughout the application:

```typescript
// Example usage of AuthContext
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

function ProfileScreen() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, signOut } = useAuth();
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <LoginPrompt />;
  }
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome, {user.displayName}</Text>
      <Button title="Sign Out" onPress={signOut} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Athlete Verification Workflow

The athlete verification process follows these steps:

1. **Registration**: Athlete creates an account with the 'athlete' role
2. **Document Submission**: Athlete submits verification documents
3. **Admin Review**: Administrators review the submitted documents
4. **Verification**: Admin approves or rejects the verification request
5. **Status Update**: Athlete's account is updated with verification status

### Verification Document Types

Athletes can submit these document types for verification:

1. **ID Document**: Government-issued identification
2. **Professional Proof**: Evidence of professional athletic career
   - Team contracts
   - League ID cards
   - Official team/league documentation
   - Media coverage

### Verification Implementation

The verification process is implemented in `AuthService.submitAthleteVerification`:

```typescript
// Example athlete verification submission
async function submitVerification(userId) {
  const verificationData = {
    fullName: 'Michael Jordan',
    sport: 'Basketball',
    team: 'Chicago Bulls',
    idDocument: 'https://storage.url/id-document.jpg',
    proofOfAthleticCareer: 'https://storage.url/contract.pdf'
  };
  
  await authService.submitAthleteVerification(userId, verificationData);
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security

1. **Password Requirements**: Enforced minimum complexity
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
3. **Session Management**: Proper token handling and expiration
4. **Secure Storage**: Credentials never stored in plain text

### Verification Security

1. **Document Storage**: Secure storage with restricted access
2. **Admin-Only Review**: Only administrators can review documents
3. **Audit Trail**: All verification actions are logged
4. **Document Expiration**: Temporary URLs for document access

## Best Practices

### Authentication Flow

1. **Progressive Profiling**: Collect minimal information at signup, gather more later
2. **Seamless Experience**: Minimize friction in the authentication process
3. **Error Handling**: Clear, user-friendly error messages
4. **Remember Me**: Option to persist authentication state

### Verification Process

1. **Clear Instructions**: Guide athletes through the verification process
2. **Status Updates**: Keep athletes informed about verification status
3. **Secure Upload**: Direct-to-storage uploads for verification documents
4. **Verification Badges**: Visually indicate verified athletes

## Testing

The authentication system includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual authentication methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete authentication flows
3. **Security Tests**: Verify authentication security measures
4. **Mock Verification**: Test verification workflow with mock data

Run authentication tests with:
```
npm run test:unit -- --testPathPattern="services/AuthService"
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues

1. **Social Auth Failures**: Usually caused by incorrect OAuth configuration
2. **Session Expiration**: Implement silent refresh for tokens
3. **Platform Differences**: Handle platform-specific authentication flows

### Verification Issues

1. **Document Upload Failures**: Check storage permissions and file size limits
2. **Verification Delays**: Implement status notifications
3. **Document Format Issues**: Provide clear guidelines on acceptable formats

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during authentication operations
2. **Persistent Login**: Remember user sessions appropriately
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback authentication methods
4. **Verification Transparency**: Clear communication about verification status and timeline
