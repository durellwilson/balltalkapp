# BallTalk App Recovery Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Invalid Root Layout File**: Deleted an invalid `_layout.tsx` file in the root directory that contained syntax errors.

2. **Consolidated Hidden Screens**: Moved all hidden screens from the `app/(tabs)` directory to their appropriate locations:
   - Studio-related screens moved to `app/studio/`
   - Chat-related screens moved to `app/chat/`
   - Admin-related screens moved to `app/admin/`
   - Profile-related screens moved to the root `app/` directory

3. **Created Proper Navigation Structure**:
   - Created a proper stack navigation layout for the Studio section
   - Created a proper stack navigation layout for the Chat section
   - Created a proper stack navigation layout for the Admin section

4. **Cleaned Up Tab Navigation**:
   - Removed hidden screen references from the tabs layout file
   - Ensured only the main 4 tabs (Home, Studio, Profile, Chat) are visible

5. **Created Index Files**:
   - Added index files for the Studio, Chat, and Admin sections

## Current Structure

The app now follows a more organized structure:

```

2. **Update Import Statements**: Check and update any import statements that might be referencing the old file locations.

3. **Clean Up Screens Directory**: Continue moving screens from the `/screens` directory to the `/app` directory.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all features with different user types as outlined in the `TESTING-PLAN.md` file.

5. **Fix Any Remaining Issues**: Address any issues that might arise during testing.

## Conclusion

The main tabs (Home, Studio, Profile, Chat) are properly configured and visible, and all features are accessible through their respective sections.
