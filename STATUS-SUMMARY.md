# BallTalk App Status Summary

## Current Status

The BallTalk app has been restructured to use a consistent navigation pattern with Expo Router. Here's the current status of the app:

### Tab Navigation
- ✅ 4 main tabs (Home, Studio, Profile, Chat) are properly configured and visible
- ✅ Studio tab links to the studio section with proper stack navigation 
- ✅ Chat tab links to the chat section with proper stack navigation

- ✅ Vocal Isolation feature
- ✅ Dolby Audio Demo feature
- ✅ Save and Export feature

### Organization
- ✅ All studio features are consolidated in the `/app/studio` directory
- ✅ All chat features are consolidated in the `/app/chat` directory
- ✅ Authentication is handled in the `/app/(auth)` directory
- ✅ Payment and subscription features are in the `/app/payment` directory
- ✅ Admin features are consolidated in the `/app/admin` directory

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dual Routing Systems**: Standardized on Expo Router for all navigation
2. **Tab Navigation**: Reduced visible tabs to 4 while hiding extra screens
3. **Studio Layout**: Changed from nested tabs to stack navigation
4. **Navigation Paths**: Fixed broken navigation paths
5. **Code Duplication**: Consolidated duplicate code from `/screens` into `/app`
6. **Extra Tab Files**: Moved all extra files from the `app/(tabs)` directory to appropriate directories
7. **Invalid Root Layout**: Removed invalid `_layout.tsx` file in the root directory
8. **Duplicate Files**: Removed duplicate files between `/screens` and `/app` directories
9. **File Naming**: Fixed inconsistent file naming (standardized on kebab-case)
10. **Feature Organization**: Moved files to their appropriate feature directories

## Known Issues

1. ⚠️ **Missing Screens**: Several screens are missing and need to be created:
   - /login
   - /verification-test
   - /community
   - /onboarding/athlete
   - /onboarding/fan

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Update Import Statements**: Check and update any import statements that might be referencing old file locations
2. ⚠️ **Create Missing Screens**: Create the missing screens identified by the `check-screen-integration.js` script
3. ⚠️ **Fix Template Variables**: Search for and fix any template variables that weren't properly replaced
4. ⚠️ **Fix Invalid Navigation Paths**: Update the invalid navigation paths identified by the `integration-test.js` script
5. ⚠️ **Fix Jest Configuration**: Update the Jest configuration to properly run the navigation tests
6. ⚠️ **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all features with different user types
7. ✅ **Code Review**: Review the codebase for any remaining issues or inconsistencies
8. ✅ **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new codebase organization

## Testing
