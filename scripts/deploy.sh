## Animation Improvements ($(date +%Y-%m-%d))

The following animation improvements were made to enhance the user experience:

1. **Studio DAW Animations**
   - Added smooth transitions between different views (welcome, recording, editing)
   - Implemented spring animations for interactive elements
   - Added drag and drop animations for tracks with visual feedback
   - Enhanced recording interface with pulsing animations and smooth transitions

2. **Chat Animations**
   - Added entrance animations for conversation items
   - Implemented smooth transitions for message bubbles
   - Added reaction picker animations
   - Enhanced attachment previews with zoom animations

3. **Tab Navigation**
   - Ensured only 4 tabs are displayed at any time based on user role
   - Athletes: Home, Studio, Profile, Chat
   - Fans: Home, Discover, Profile, Chat

These improvements create a more modern, sleek, and responsive feel throughout the app.
