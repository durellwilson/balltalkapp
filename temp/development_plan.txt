    * Conduct regular peer code reviews.
    * Establish and enforce coding standards.
5.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Write and execute unit tests for individual components and modules.
    *   Achieve high code coverage (e.g., 80% or more).

**Dependencies:**

*   Completed feature design documents.
*   Defined API specifications.
*   Database setup and configuration.

**Success Criteria:**

*   All core features are implemented and functional.
*   Backend and frontend are successfully integrated.
*   Unit tests are passing with high code coverage.
*   Code reviews completed.

### Phase 2: Deployment

**Scope:** This phase focuses on packaging and deploying the application to a production environment.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Configure production servers and databases.
    *   Set up necessary security measures (firewalls, SSL certificates).
2.  **Build & Packaging:**
    *   Create a production build of the application.
    *   Package the application for deployment (e.g., Docker containers).
3.  **Deployment Automation:**
    *   Set up a continuous deployment pipeline (CI/CD).
    *   Automate deployment to the production environment.
4.  **Database Migration:**
    *   Migrate data from the development or staging environment to production.
    *   Verify data integrity.
5. **Monitoring:**
    *   Set up application performance monitoring.
    * Set up error logging.

**Dependencies:**

*   Completed development phase.
*   Production infrastructure is set up.
*   Deployment pipeline configured.

**Success Criteria:**

*   Application is successfully deployed to production.
*   All environment configurations are correct.
*   Automated deployment pipeline is functional.
* Database migration done without error.

### Phase 3: Testing

**Scope:** This phase focuses on rigorous testing to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Test interactions between different components and services.
    *   Verify API calls and data flow.
    *   Test authentication and authorization across the whole stack.
    *   Verify that the recorded song is well uploaded, stored and can be downloaded and visualized by another user.
2.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   Test complete user workflows from start to finish.
    *   Simulate real user interactions with the application.
    *   Verify that the recorded song is well uploaded, stored and can be downloaded and visualized by another user.
3.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   Evaluate application performance under load.
    *   Identify and address performance bottlenecks.
4.  **Security Testing:**
    *   Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
    *   Ensure data security and protection.
5.  **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   Allow end-users to test the application in a staging environment.
    *   Gather feedback and address any issues.
6. **Continuous testing**
    * Run integration testing every time we merge to main.
    * Run end to end test every time we release.

**Dependencies:**

*   Completed deployment phase.
*   Test environments set up.

**Success Criteria:**

*   All tests are passing.
*   Application performs well under load.
*   No security vulnerabilities are identified.
*   End-users are satisfied with the application.

### Integration Testing Implementation

*   **Tools:** Use tools like Cypress, Jest, Mocha, or Supertest.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Write tests that cover interactions between APIs and UI components.
    *   Mock external services if necessary.
    *   Verify data consistency across components.
* **Recorded song management**
    * Test the upload process
    * Test the storing process
    * Test the download process.
    * Test the sharing process.

### End-to-End Testing Implementation

*   **Tools:** Use tools like Cypress, Selenium, or Playwright.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Automate full user flows, such as logging in, creating and recording song, saving it, sharing it and downloading it by another user.
    *   Use realistic test data.
    *   Test the application in a production-like environment.
*   **Recorded song management**
    * Create a user
    * Log in the user
    * Record a song.
    * Save the song.
    * Share the song with another user.
    * log out
    * Log in the other user.
    * Download the song.
    * Check if the song is available.

### Continuous Integration

*   **Tools:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions.
*   **Workflow:**
    *   Automatically trigger unit and integration tests on every code commit.
    *   Run build and deployment processes on successful test runs.
    *   Use code quality tools (e.g., SonarQube) to analyze code quality.

### Regular Testing Throughout the Development Lifecycle

*   Integrate testing throughout all phases.
*   Early and frequent testing allows early detection of error.
*   Run automated tests on every code commit.
*   Conduct manual tests for complex flows.
